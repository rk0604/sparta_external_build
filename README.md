# opt/ (remote HPC toolchain + sources)

This repo contains my HPC toolchain and sources used on a remote box:
- SPARTA + Kokkos CUDA build scripts/configs
- run harness notes and environment setup
- (Build artifacts are ignored via .gitignore)

If you clone this, you'll need to rebuild locally (see notes and scripts).
